NAME
       mc - Visual shell for Unix-like systems.

USAGE
       mc [-abcCdfhPstuUVx] [-l log] [dir1 [dir2]] [-e [file]] [-v file]

DESCRIPTION
       GNU  Midnight  Commander  is a directory browser/file manager for Unix-
       like operating systems.

OPTIONS
       -a, --stickchars
              Disable usage of graphic characters for line drawing.

       -b, --nocolor
              Force black and white display.

       -c, --color
              Force color mode, please  check  the  section  Colors  for  more
              information.

       -C arg, --colors=arg
              Specify  a  different color set in the command line.  The format
              of arg is documented in the Colors section.

       -d, --nomouse
              Disable mouse support.

       -e [file], --edit[=file]
              Start the internal editor.  If the file is specified, open it on
              startup.  See also mcedit (1).

       -f, --datadir
              Display  the  compiled-in  search  paths  for Midnight Commander
              files.

       -k, --resetsoft
              Reset softkeys to their default from the termcap/terminfo  data-
              base.  Only  useful on HP terminals when the function keys don't
              work.

       -l file, --ftplog=file
              Save the ftpfs dialog with the server in file.

       -P file, --printwd=file
              Print the last working directory to the  specified  file.   This
              option  is  not  meant  to be used directly.  Instead, it's used
              from a special shell script that automatically changes the  cur-
              rent  directory  of the shell to the last directory the Midnight
              Commander was in.  Source the file /usr/share/mc/bin/mc.sh (bash
              and  zsh users) or /usr/share/mc/bin/mc.csh (tcsh users) respec-
              tively to define mc as an alias to the appropriate shell script.

       -s, --slow
              Turn on the slow terminal mode, in this mode  the  program  will
              not  draw expensive line drawing characters and will toggle ver-
              bose mode off.

       -t, --termcap
              Used only if the code was compiled with Slang and  terminfo:  it
              makes  the Midnight Commander use the value of the TERMCAP vari-
              able for the terminal information instead of the information  on
              the system wide terminal database

       -u, --nosubshell
              Disable  use  of  the  concurrent shell (only makes sense if the
              Midnight Commander has been built  with  concurrent  shell  sup-
              port).

       -U, --subshell
              Enable  use of the concurrent shell support (only makes sense if
              the Midnight Commander was built with the subshell  support  set
              as an optional feature).

       -v file, --view=file
              Start  the internal viewer to view the specified file.  See also
              mcview (1).

       -V, --version
              Display the version of the program.

       -x, --xterm
              Force xterm mode.  Used when running on xterm-capable  terminals
              (two screen modes, and able to send mouse escape sequences).

       If  specified,  the  first  path  name  is the directory to show in the
       selected panel; the second path name is the directory to  be  shown  in
       the other panel.

Overview
       The  screen  of  the  Midnight  Commander  is  divided into four parts.
       Almost all of the screen space is taken up by two directory panels.  By
       default,  the  second  line  from the bottom of the screen is the shell
       command line, and the bottom line shows the function key  labels.   The
       topmost  line is the menu bar line.  The menu bar line may not be visi-
       ble, but appears if you click the topmost line with the mouse or  press
       the F9 key.

       The  Midnight  Commander provides a view of two directories at the same
       time. One of the panels is the current panel (a selection bar is in the
       current  panel). Almost all operations take place on the current panel.
       Some file operations like Rename and Copy by default use the  directory
       of  the unselected panel as a destination (don't worry, they always ask
       you for confirmation first). For more information, see the sections  on
       the Directory Panels, the Left and Right Menus and the File Menu.

       You  can  execute system commands from the Midnight Commander by simply
       typing them. Everything you type will appear on the shell command line,
       and  when  you press Enter the Midnight Commander will execute the com-
       mand line you typed; read the Shell Command Line and  Input  Line  Keys
       sections to learn more about the command line.

Mouse Support
       The Midnight Commander comes with mouse support.  It is activated when-
       ever you are running on an xterm(1) terminal (it even works if you take
       a  telnet,  ssh or rlogin connection to another machine from the xterm)
       or if you are running on a Linux console and have the gpm mouse  server
       running.

       When  you  left  click  on a file in the directory panels, that file is
       selected; if you click with the right button, the file  is  marked  (or
       unmarked, depending on the previous state).

       Double-clicking  on  a file will try to execute the command if it is an
       executable program; and if the extension file has a  program  specified
       for the file's extension, the specified program is executed.

       Also,  it  is possible to execute the commands assigned to the function
       key labels by clicking on them.

       If a mouse button is clicked on the top frame  line  of  the  directory
       panel,  it  is  scrolled  one page up.  Likewise, a click on the bottom
       frame line will cause scrolling one page down.  This frame line  method
       works also in the Help Viewer and the Directory Tree.

       The default auto repeat rate for the mouse buttons is 400 milliseconds.
       This may be changed to other values by editing the ~/.mc/ini  file  and
       changing the mouse_repeat_rate parameter.

       If  you  are running the Midnight Commander with the mouse support, you
       can get the default mouse behavior (cutting and pasting text) by  hold-
       ing down the Shift key.


Keys
       Some  commands in the Midnight Commander involve the use of the Control
       (sometimes labeled CTRL or CTL) and the Meta (sometimes labeled ALT  or
       even  Compose) keys. In this manual we will use the following abbrevia-
       tions:

       C-<chr>
              means hold the Control key while  typing  the  character  <chr>.
              Thus C-f would be: hold the Control key and type f.

       M-<chr>
              means  hold  the  Meta  or  Alt key down while typing <chr>.  If
              there is no Meta or Alt key, type ESC, release it, then type the
              character <chr>.

       S-<chr>
              means hold the Shift key down while typing <chr>.

       All  input  lines in the Midnight Commander use an approximation to the
       GNU Emacs editor's key bindings.

       There are many sections which tell about the keys.  The  following  are
       the most important.

       The File Menu section documents the keyboard shortcuts for the commands
       appearing in the File menu. This section includes  the  function  keys.
       Most  of  these  commands  perform some action, usually on the selected
       file or the tagged files.

       The Directory Panels section documents the keys which select a file  or
       tag  files  as  a  target for a later action (the action is usually one
       from the file menu).

       The Shell Command Line section list the keys which are used for  enter-
       ing  and  editing command lines. Most of these copy file names and such
       from the directory panels to the command line (to avoid excessive  typ-
       ing) or access the command line history.

       Input  Line  Keys are used for editing input lines. This means both the
       command line and the input lines in the query dialogs.

  Miscellaneous Keys
       Here are some keys which don't fall into any of the other categories:

       Enter  if there is some text in the command line (the one at the bottom
              of  the  panels),  then that command is executed. If there is no
              text in the command line then if the selection  bar  is  over  a
              directory the Midnight Commander does a chdir(2) to the selected
              directory and reloads the  information  on  the  panel;  if  the
              selection is an executable file then it is executed. Finally, if
              the extension of the selected  file  name  matches  one  of  the
              extensions in the extensions file then the corresponding command
              is executed.

       C-l    repaint all the information in the Midnight Commander.

       C-x c  run the Chmod command on a file or on the tagged files.

       C-x o  run the Chown command on the  current  file  or  on  the  tagged
              files.

       C-x l  run the link command.

       C-x s  run the symbolic link command.

       C-x i  set the other panel display mode to information.

       C-x q  set the other panel display mode to quick view.

       C-x !  execute the External panelize command.

       C-x h  run the add directory to hotlist command.

       M-!    executes  the  Filtered view command, described in the view com-
              mand.

       M-?    executes the Find file command.

       M-c    pops up the quick cd dialog.

       C-o    when the program is being run in the Linux or FreeBSD console or
              under an xterm, it will show you the output of the previous com-
              mand.  When ran on the Linux  console,  the  Midnight  Commander
              uses  an  external  program  (cons.saver)  to  handle saving and
              restoring of information on the screen.

       When the subshell support is compiled in, you can type C-o at any  time
       and  you  will  be taken back to the Midnight Commander main screen, to
       return to your application just type C-o.  If you have  an  application
       suspended  by using this trick, you won't be able to execute other pro-
       grams from the Midnight Commander until  you  terminate  the  suspended
       application.

  Directory Panels
       This  section  lists the keys which operate on the directory panels. If
       you want to know how to change the appearance of the panels take a look
       at the section on Left and Right Menus.

       Tab, C-i
              change  the  current  panel. The old other panel becomes the new
              current panel and the old current panel becomes  the  new  other
              panel. The selection bar moves from the old current panel to the
              new current panel.

       Insert, C-t
              to tag files you may use the  Insert  key  (the  kich1  terminfo
              sequence)  or the C-t (Control-t) sequence. To untag files, just
              retag a tagged file.

       M-g, M-r, M-j
              used to select the top file in a panel, the middle file and  the
              bottom one, respectively.

       C-s, M-s
              start  a  filename  search  in  the  directory listing. When the
              search is active, the user input will be  added  to  the  search
              string  instead  of  the  command  line. If the Show mini-status
              option is enabled the search string is shown on the  mini-status
              line.  When typing, the selection bar will move to the next file
              starting with the typed letters. The backspace or DEL  keys  can
              be used to correct typing mistakes. If C-s is pressed again, the
              next match is searched for.

       M-t    toggle the current display listing  to  show  the  next  display
              listing  mode.   With this it is possible to quickly switch from
              long listing to regular listing and  the  user  defined  listing
              mode.

       C-\ (control-backslash)
              show the directory hotlist and change to the selected directory.

       +  (plus)
              this is used to select (tag) a group of files. The Midnight Com-
              mander will prompt  for  a  regular  expression  describing  the
              group.  When  Shell Patterns are enabled, the regular expression
              is much like the regular expressions in the  shell  (*  standing
              for  zero or more characters and ?  standing for one character).
              If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging of files is done with
              normal regular expressions (see ed (1)).

       If  the expression starts or ends with a slash (/), then it will select
       directories instead of files.

       \ (backslash)
              use the "\" key to unselect a group of files. This is the  oppo-
              site of the Plus key.

       up-key, C-p
              move the selection bar to the previous entry in the panel.

       down-key, C-n
              move the selection bar to the next entry in the panel.

       home, a1, M-<
              move the selection bar to the first entry in the panel.

       end, c1, M->
              move the selection bar to the last entry in the panel.

       next-page, C-v
              move the selection bar one page down.

       prev-page, M-v
              move the selection bar one page up.

       M-o    make the current directory of the current panel also the current
              directory of the other panel.  Put the other panel to the  list-
              ing  mode  if  needed.   If  the current panel is panelized, the
              other panel doesn't become panelized.

       C-PageUp, C-PageDown
              only when supported by the terminal: change to ".." and  to  the
              currently selected directory respectively.

       M-y    moves  to  the  previous directory in the history, equivalent to
              clicking the < with the mouse.

       M-u    moves to the next directory in the history, equivalent to click-
              ing the > with the mouse.

       M-S-h, M-H
              displays the directory history, equivalent to depressing the 'v'
              with the mouse.

  Shell Command Line
       This section lists keys which are useful to avoid excessive typing when
       entering shell commands.

       M-Enter
              copy the currently selected file name to the command line.

       C-Enter
              same  a M-Enter.  May not work on remote systems and some termi-
              nals.

       C-S-Enter
              copy the full path name of the currently selected  file  to  the
              command  line.   May  not work on remote systems and some termi-
              nals.

       M-Tab  does the filename, command, variable, username and hostname com-
              pletion for you.

       C-x t, C-x C-t
              copy  the  tagged  files  (or  if there are no tagged files, the
              selected file) of the current panel (C-x  t)  or  of  the  other
              panel (C-x C-t) to the command line.

       C-x p, C-x C-p
              the  first key sequence copies the current path name to the com-
              mand line, and the second one copies the unselected panel's path
              name to the command line.

       C-q    the quote command can be used to insert characters that are oth-
              erwise interpreted by the Midnight Commander (like the '+'  sym-
              bol)

       M-p, M-n
              use  these keys to browse through the command history. M-p takes
              you to the last entry, M-n takes you to the next one.

       M-h    displays the history for the current input line.

  General Movement Keys
       The help viewer, the file viewer and the directory tree use common code
       to  handle moving. Therefore they accept exactly the same keys. Each of
       them also accepts some keys of its own.

       Other parts of the Midnight Commander use some  of  the  same  movement
       keys, so this section may be of use for those parts too.

       Up, C-p
              moves one line backward.

       Down, C-n
              moves one line forward.

       Prev Page, Page Up, M-v
              moves one page up.

       Next Page, Page Down, C-v
              moves one page down.

       Home, A1
              moves to the beginning.

       End, C1
              move to the end.

       The  help viewer and the file viewer accept the following keys in addi-
       tion the to ones mentioned above:

       b, C-b, C-h, Backspace, Delete
              moves one page up.

       Space bar
              moves one page down.

       u, d   moves one half of a page up or down.

       g, G   moves to the beginning or to the end.

  Input Line Keys
       The input lines (they are used for the command line and for  the  query
       dialogs in the program) accept these keys:

       C-a    puts the cursor at the beginning of line.

       C-e    puts the cursor at the end of the line.

       C-b, move-left
              move the cursor one position left.

       C-f, move-right
              move the cursor one position right.

       M-f    moves one word forward.

       M-b    moves one word backward.

       C-h, backspace
              delete the previous character.

       C-d, Delete
              delete the character in the point (over the cursor).

       C-@    sets the mark for cutting.

       C-w    copies the text between the cursor and the mark to a kill buffer
              and removes the text from the input line.

       M-w    copies the text between the cursor and the mark to a  kill  buf-
              fer.

       C-y    yanks back the contents of the kill buffer.

       C-k    kills the text from the cursor to the end of the line.

       M-p, M-n
              Use  these keys to browse through the command history. M-p takes
              you to the last entry, M-n takes you to the next one.

       M-C-h, M-Backspace
              delete one word backward.

       M-Tab  does the filename, command, variable, username and hostname com-
              pletion for you.


Menu Bar
       The  menu  bar  pops up when you press F9 or click the mouse on the top
       row of the screen. The menu bar has five menus: "Left",  "File",  "Com-
       mand", "Options" and "Right".

       The Left and Right Menus allow you to modify the appearance of the left
       and right directory panels.

       The File Menu lists the  actions  you  can  perform  on  the  currently
       selected file or the tagged files.

       The  Command  Menu lists the actions which are more general and bear no
       relation to the currently selected file or the tagged files.

       The Options Menu lists the actions which allow  you  to  customize  the
       Midnight Commander.

  Left and Right (Above and Below) Menus
       The  outlook  of  the directory panels can be changed from the Left and
       Right menus (they are named Above and Below when the  horizontal  panel
       split is chosen from the Layout options dialog).

    Listing Mode...
       The  listing mode view is used to display a listing of files, there are
       four different listing modes available: Full,  Brief,  Long  and  User.
       The  full  directory view shows the file name, the size of the file and
       the modification time.

       The brief view shows only the file name and it has two columns  (there-
       fore showing twice as many files as other views). The long view is sim-
       ilar to the output of ls -l command. The  long  view  takes  the  whole
       screen width.

       If  you  choose the "User" display format, then you have to specify the
       display format.

       The user display format must start with a panel size  specifier.   This
       may  be  "half"  or  "full", and they specify a half screen panel and a
       full screen panel respectively.

       After the panel size, you may specify  the  two  columns  mode  on  the
       panel, this is done by adding the number "2" to the user format string.

       After  this you add the name of the fields with an optional size speci-
       fier.  This are the available fields you may display:

       name   displays the file name.

       size   displays the file size.

       bsize  is an alternative form of the size format. It displays the  size
              of  the  files  and  for  directories  it  just shows SUB-DIR or
              UP--DIR.

       type   displays a one character wide type  field.   This  character  is
              similar to what is displayed by ls with the -F flag - * for exe-
              cutable files, / for directories, @ for links, = for sockets,  -
              for  character  devices, + for block devices, | for pipes, ~ for
              symbolic links to directories and !  for stale  symlinks  (links
              that point nowhere).

       mark   an asterisk if the file is tagged, a space if it's not.

       mtime  file's last modification time.

       atime  file's last access time.

       ctime  file's creation time.

       perm   a string representing the current permission bits of the file.

       mode   an octal value with the current permission bits of the file.

       nlink  the number of links to the file.

       ngid   the GID (numeric).

       nuid   the UID (numeric).

       owner  the owner of the file.

       group  the group of the file.

       inode  the inode of the file.

       Also you can use following keywords to define the panel layout:

       space  a space in the display format.

       |      add a vertical line to the display format.

       To  force  one field to a fixed size (a size specifier), you just add :
       followed by the number of characters you want the field  to  have.   If
       the  number  is  followed  by the symbol +, then the size specifies the
       minimal field size - if the program finds out that there is more  space
       on the screen, it will then expand that field.

       For example, the Full display corresponds to this format:

       half type name | size | mtime

       And the Long display corresponds to this format:

       full  perm  space  nlink space owner space group space size space mtime
       space name

       This is a nice user display format:

       half name | size:7 | type mode:3

       Panels may also be set to the following modes:

       Info   The info view  display  information  related  to  the  currently
              selected file and if possible information about the current file
              system.

       Tree   The tree view is quite similar to the  directory  tree  feature.
              See the section about it for more information.

       Quick View
              In  this  mode,  the  panel will switch to a reduced viewer that
              displays the contents of the currently  selected  file,  if  you
              select  the panel (with the tab key or the mouse), you will have
              access to the usual viewer commands.

    Sort Order...
       The eight sort orders are by name, by extension, by modification  time,
       by access time, and by inode information modification time, by size, by
       inode and unsorted.  In the Sort order dialog box you  can  choose  the
       sort  order  and  you  may  also specify if you want to sort in reverse
       order by checking the reverse box.

       By default directories are sorted before files but this can be  changed
       from the Options menu (option Mix all files).

    Filter...
       The  filter  command allows you to specify a shell pattern (for example
       *.tar.gz) which the files must match to be  shown.  Regardless  of  the
       filter pattern, the directories and the links to directories are always
       shown in the directory panel.

    Reread
       The reread command reload the list of files in  the  directory.  It  is
       useful  if  other processes have created or removed files.  If you have
       panelized file names in a panel this will reload the directory contents
       and remove the panelized information (See the section External panelize
       for more information).

  File Menu
       The Midnight Commander uses the F1 - F10 keys as keyboard shortcuts for
       commands  appearing  in  the  file  menu.  The escape sequences for the
       function keys are terminfo capabilities kf1 trough kf10.  On  terminals
       without function key support, you can achieve the same functionality by
       pressing the ESC key and then a number in the range 1 through 9  and  0
       (corresponding to F1 to F9 and F10 respectively).

       The  File menu has the following commands (keyboard shortcuts in paren-
       theses):

       Help (F1)

       Invokes the built-in hypertext help viewer. Inside the help viewer, you
       can use the Tab key to select the next link and the Enter key to follow
       that link. The keys Space and Backspace are used to  move  forward  and
       backward  in  a  help  page.  Press  F1  again  to get the full list of
       accepted keys.

       Menu (F2)

       Invoke the user menu.  The user menu provides an easy  way  to  provide
       users with a menu and add extra features to the Midnight Commander.

       View (F3, Shift-F3)

       View  the currently selected file. By default this invokes the Internal
       File Viewer but if the option "Use internal view" is off, it invokes an
       external  file  viewer specified by the PAGER environment variable.  If
       PAGER is undefined, the "view" command is invoked.  If you use Shift-F3
       instead,  the  viewer  will  be invoked without doing any formatting or
       preprocessing to the file.

       Filtered View (M-!)

       This command prompts for a command  and  its  arguments  (the  argument
       defaults  to  the  currently  selected file name), the output from such
       command is shown in the internal file viewer.

       Edit (F4)

       Currently it invokes the vi editor, or the editor specified in the EDI-
       TOR environment variable, or the Internal File Editor if the use_inter-
       nal_edit option is on.

       Copy (F5)

       Pop up an input dialog with destination that defaults to the  directory
       in  the  non-selected  panel and copies the currently selected file (or
       the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to  the  direc-
       tory  specified  by  the user in the input dialog. During this process,
       you can press C-c or ESC to abort  the  operation.  For  details  about
       source  mask  (which  will be usually either * or ^\(.*\)$ depending on
       setting of Use shell patterns) and possible wildcards in  the  destina-
       tion see Mask copy/rename.

       On  some  systems,  it  is possible to do the copy in the background by
       clicking on the background button (or pressing M-b in the dialog  box).
       The Background Jobs is used to control the background process.

       Link (C-x l)

       Create a hard link to the current file.

       SymLink (C-x s)

       Create  a  symbolic link to the current file. To those of you who don't
       know what links are: creating a link to a file is a  bit  like  copying
       the  file,  but  both  the source filename and the destination filename
       represent the same file image. For example, if you edit  one  of  these
       files, all changes you make will appear in both files. Some people call
       links aliases or shortcuts.

       A hard link appears as a real file. After making it, there is no way of
       telling  which one is the original and which is the link. If you delete
       either one of them the other one is still intact. It is very  difficult
       to  notice that the files represent the same image. Use hard links when
       you don't even want to know.

       A symbolic link is a reference to the name of the original file. If the
       original file is deleted the symbolic link is useless. It is quite easy
       to notice that the files represent the same image. The Midnight Comman-
       der  shows  an  "@"-sign  in front of the file name if it is a symbolic
       link to somewhere (except to directory, where it shows  a  tilde  (~)).
       The original file which the link points to is shown on mini-status line
       if the Show mini-status option is enabled. Use symbolic links when  you
       want to avoid the confusion that can be caused by hard links.

       Rename/Move (F6)

       Pop  up  an  input  dialog  that  defaults to the directory in the non-
       selected panel and moves the currently selected  file  (or  the  tagged
       files  if there is at least one tagged file) to the directory specified
       by the user in the input dialog. During the process, you can press  C-c
       or  ESC to abort the operation. For more details look at Copy operation
       above, most of the things are quite similar.

       On some systems, it is possible to do the copy  in  the  background  by
       clicking  on the background button (or pressing M-b in the dialog box).
       The Background Jobs is used to control the background process.

       Mkdir (F7)

       Pop up an input dialog and creates the directory specified.

       Delete (F8)

       Delete the currently selected file or the tagged files in the currently
       selected  panel.  During the process, you can press C-c or ESC to abort
       the operation.

       Quick cd (M-c) Use the quick cd command if you have full  command  line
       and want to cd somewhere.

       Select group (+)

       This  is  used to select (tag) a group of files. The Midnight Commander
       will prompt for a regular expression describing the group.  When  Shell
       Patterns  are enabled, the regular expression is much like the filename
       globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or  more  characters  and  ?
       standing for one character). If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging
       of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed (1)).

       To mark directories instead of files, the expression must start or  end
       with a '/'.

       Unselect group (\)

       Used  to  unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the Select
       group command.

       Quit (F10, Shift-F10)

       Terminate the Midnight Commander.  Shift-F10 is used when you  want  to
       quit  and you are using the shell wrapper.  Shift-F10 will not take you
       to the last directory you visited with the Midnight Commander,  instead
       it will stay at the directory where you started the Midnight Commander.

    Quick cd
       This  command  is useful if you have a full command line and want to cd
       somewhere without having to yank and paste the command line. This  com-
       mand pops up a small dialog, where you enter everything you would enter
       after cd on the command line and then you press  enter.  This  features
       all the things that are already in the internal cd command.

  Command Menu
       The Directory tree command shows a tree figure of the directories.

       The  Find  file  command  allows you to search for a specific file. The
       "Swap panels" command swaps the contents of the two directory panels.

       The "Panels on/off" command shows the output of the last shell command.
       This works only on xterm and on Linux and FreeBSD console.

       The  Compare  directories (C-x d) command compares the directory panels
       with each other. You can then use the Copy (F5)  command  to  make  the
       panels  identical.  There  are  three compare methods. The quick method
       compares only file size and file date. The thorough method makes a full
       byte-by-byte  compare.  The  thorough  method  is  not available if the
       machine does not support the mmap(2) system call.  The  size-only  com-
       pare  method  just  compares the file sizes and does not check the con-
       tents or the date times, it just checks the file size.

       The Command history  command  shows  a  list  of  typed  commands.  The
       selected command is copied to the command line. The command history can
       also be accessed by typing M-p or M-n.

       The Directory hotlist (C-\)  command  makes  changing  of  the  current
       directory to often used directories faster.

       The  External  panelize  allows you to execute an external program, and
       make the output of that program the contents of the current panel.

       Extension file edit command allows you to specify programs to  executed
       when  you  try  to execute, view, edit and do a bunch of other thing on
       files with certain extensions (filename endings). The  Menu  file  edit
       command  may be used for editing the user menu (which appears by press-
       ing F2).

    Directory Tree
       The Directory Tree command shows a tree figure of the directories.  You
       can  select a directory from the figure and the Midnight Commander will
       change to that directory.

       There are two ways to invoke the tree. The real directory tree  command
       is  available  from Commands menu. The other way is to select tree view
       from the Left or Right menu.

       To get rid of long delays the Midnight Commander creates the tree  fig-
       ure  by  scanning  only  a  small subset of all the directories. If the
       directory which you want to see is missing, move to its  parent  direc-
       tory and press C-r (or F2).

       You can use the following keys:

       General movement keys are accepted.

       Enter.   In the directory tree, exits the directory tree and changes to
       this directory in the current panel. In the tree view, changes to  this
       directory in the other panel and stays in tree view mode in the current
       panel.

       C-r, F2 (Rescan).  Rescan this directory. Use this when the tree figure
       is  out of date: it is missing subdirectories or shows some subdirecto-
       ries which don't exist any more.

       F3 (Forget).  Delete this directory from the tree figure. Use  this  to
       remove  clutter  from the figure. If you want the directory back to the
       tree figure press F2 in its parent directory.

       F4  (Static/Dynamic).   Toggle  between  the  dynamic  navigation  mode
       (default) and the static navigation mode.

       In  the  static  navigation  mode  you  can use the Up and Down keys to
       select a directory. All known directories are shown.

       In the dynamic navigation mode you can use the  Up  and  Down  keys  to
       select  a  sibling directory, the Left key to move to the parent direc-
       tory, and the Right key to move to a child directory. Only the  parent,
       sibling  and  children  directories are shown, others are left out. The
       tree figure changes dynamically as you traverse.

       F5 (Copy).  Copy the directory.

       F6 (RenMov).  Move the directory.

       F7 (Mkdir).  Make a new directory below this directory.

       F8 (Delete).  Delete this directory from the file system.

       C-s, M-s.  Search the next directory matching  the  search  string.  If
       there is no such directory these keys will move one line down.

       C-h, Backspace.  Delete the last character of the search string.

       Any  other  character.  Add the character to the search string and move
       to the next directory which starts with these characters. In  the  tree
       view  you  must  first  activate  the  search mode by pressing C-s. The
       search string is shown in the mini status line.

       The following actions are available only in the  directory  tree.  They
       aren't supported in the tree view.

       F1 (Help).  Invoke the help viewer and show this section.

       Esc, F10.  Exit the directory tree. Do not change the directory.

       The mouse is supported. A double-click behaves like Enter. See also the
       section on mouse support.

    Find File
       The Find File feature first asks for the start directory for the search
       and  the  filename  to be searched for. By pressing the Tree button you
       can select the start directory from the directory tree figure.

       The contents field accepts regular  expressions  similar  to  egrep(1).
       That  means  you  have  to  escape characters with a special meaning to
       egrep with "\", e.g. if you search for "strcmp  ("  you  will  have  to
       input "strcmp \(" (without the double quotes).

       You  can start the search by pressing the OK button.  During the search
       you can stop from the Stop button and continue from the Start button.

       You can browse the filelist with the up and down arrow keys. The  Chdir
       button will change to the directory of the currently selected file. The
       Again button will ask for the parameters for a  new  search.  The  Quit
       button  quits  the search operation. The Panelize button will place the
       found files to the current directory panel so that  you  can  do  addi-
       tional  operations  on them (view, copy, move, delete and so on). After
       panelizing you can press C-r to return to the normal file listing.

       It is possible to have a list of directories that the Find File command
       should  skip  during  the  search  (for  example, you may want to avoid
       searches on a CD-ROM or on a NFS directory that  is  mounted  across  a
       slow link).

       Directories   to   be   skipped   should   be   set   on  the  variable
       find_ignore_dirs in the Misc section of your ~/.mc/ini file.

       Directory components should be separated with a colon, here is an exam-
       ple:

       [Misc]
       find_ignore_dirs=/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs

       You  may  consider  using the External panelize command for some opera-
       tions. Find file command is for simple queries only, while using Exter-
       nal panelize you can do as mysterious searches as you would like.

    External panelize
       The  External  panelize  allows you to execute an external program, and
       make the output of that program the contents of the current panel.

       For example, if you want to manipulate in one of  the  panels  all  the
       symbolic links in the current directory, you can use external paneliza-
       tion to run the following command:

       find . -type l -print

       Upon command completion, the directory contents of the  panel  will  no
       longer  be  the directory listing of the current directory, but all the
       files that are symbolic links.

       If you want to panelize all of the files that have been downloaded from
       your  FTP server, you can use this awk command to extract the file name
       from the transfer log files:

       awk '$9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 }' < /usr/adm/xferlog

       You may want to save often used panelize commands under  a  descriptive
       name,  so  that  you can recall them quickly. You do this by typing the
       command on the input line and pressing Add new button. Then you enter a
       name  under which you want the command to be saved. Next time, you just
       choose that command from the list and do not have to type it again.

    Hotlist
       The Directory hotlist command shows the labels of  the  directories  in
       the  directory  hotlist.   The  Midnight  Commander  will change to the
       directory corresponding to the selected label.  From the  hotlist  dia-
       log,  you  can remove already created label/directory pairs and add new
       ones.  To add new directories quickly, you can use the Add  to  hotlist
       command  (C-x  h),  which adds the current directory into the directory
       hotlist, asking just for the label for the directory.

       This makes cd to often used directories faster. You may consider  using
       the CDPATH variable as described in internal cd command description.

    Extension File Edit
       This will invoke your editor on the file ~/.mc/bindings.  The format of
       this file following:

       All lines starting with # or empty lines are thrown away.

       Lines starting in the first column should have following format:

       keyword/expr, i.e. everything after the slash until new line is expr.

       keyword can be:

       shell  - expr is an extension (no wildcards).  File matches it its name
              ends with expr.  Example: shell/.tar matches *.tar.

       regex  -  expr  is  a  regular  expression.   File  matches if its name
              matches the regular expression.

       directory
              - expr is a regular expression.  File matches if it is a  direc-
              tory and its name matches the regular expression.

       type   -  expr  is a regular expression.  File matches if the output of
              file %f without the initial  "filename:"  part  matches  regular
              expression expr.

       default
              - matches any file.  expr is ignored.

       include
              - denotes a common section.  expr is the name of the section.

       Other  lines should start with a space or tab and should be of the for-
       mat: keyword=command (with no spaces around =),  where  keyword  should
       be:  Open  (invoked  on Enter or double click), View (F3), Edit (F4) or
       Include (to add rules from the common section).  command  is  any  one-
       line shell command, with the simple macro substitution.

       Rules  are matched from top to bottom, thus the order is important.  If
       the appropriate action is missing, search continues  as  if  this  rule
       didn't  match  (i.e.  if  a file matches the first and second entry and
       View action is missing in the first one, then on pressing F3  the  View
       action  from  the second entry will be used).  default should match all
       the actions.

    Background Jobs
       This lets you control the state of any  background  Midnight  Commander
       process  (only  copy and move files operations can be done in the back-
       ground).  You can stop, restart and kill a background job from here.

    Menu File Edit
       The user menu is a menu of useful actions that can be customized by the
       user. When you access the user menu, the file .mc.menu from the current
       directory is used if it exists, but only if it is owned by user or root
       and  is not world-writable.  If no such file found, ~/.mc/menu is tried
       in the same way, and otherwise mc uses  the  default  system-wide  menu
       /usr/share/mc/mc.menu.

       The  format of the menu file is very simple. Lines that start with any-
       thing but space or tab are considered entries for the menu (in order to
       be  able to use it like a hot key, the first character should be a let-
       ter). All the lines that start with a space or a tab are  the  commands
       that will be executed when the entry is selected.

       When  an  option  is  selected  all the command lines of the option are
       copied  to  a  temporary  file  in  the  temporary  directory  (usually
       /usr/tmp)  and  then that file is executed. This allows the user to put
       normal shell constructs in the menus. Also  simple  macro  substitution
       takes  place  before executing the menu code. For more information, see
       macro substitution.

       Here is a sample mc.menu file:

       A    Dump the currently selected file
            od -c %f

       B    Edit a bug report and send it to root
            I=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mail.XXXXXX` || exit 1
            vi $I
            mail -s "Midnight Commander bug" root < $I
            rm -f $I

       M    Read mail
            emacs -f rmail

       N    Read Usenet news
            emacs -f gnus

       H    Call the info hypertext browser

       Default Conditions

       Each menu entry may be preceded by  a  condition.  The  condition  must
       start  from  the first column with a '=' character. If the condition is
       true, the menu entry will be the default entry.

       Condition syntax:   = <sub-cond>
         or:               = <sub-cond> | <sub-cond> ...
         or:               = <sub-cond> & <sub-cond> ...

       Sub-condition is one of following:

         y <pattern>       syntax of current file matching pattern?
                      (for edit menu only)
         f <pattern>       current file matching pattern?
         F <pattern>       other file matching pattern?
         d <pattern>       current directory matching pattern?
         D <pattern>       other directory matching pattern?
         t <type>          current file of type?
         T <type>          other file of type?
         x <filename>      is it executable filename?
         ! <sub-cond>      negate the result of sub-condition

       Pattern is a normal shell pattern or a regular expression, according to
       the  shell  patterns  option.  You can override the global value of the
       shell patterns option by writing "shell_patterns=x" on the  first  line
       of the menu file (where "x" is either 0 or 1).

       Type is one or more of the following characters:

         n  not a directory
         r  regular file
         d  directory
         l  link
         c  character device
         b  block device
         f  FIFO (pipe)
         s  socket
         x  executable file
         t  tagged

       For example 'rlf' means either regular file, link or fifo. The 't' type
       is a little special because it acts on the panel instead of  the  file.
       The  condition  '=t t' is true if there are tagged files in the current
       panel and false if not.

       If the condition starts with '=?' instead of '=' a debug trace will  be
       shown whenever the value of the condition is calculated.

       The conditions are calculated from left to right. This means
            = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
       is calculated as
            ( (f *.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) & (t n)

       Here is a sample of the use of conditions:

       = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
       L    List the contents of a compressed tar-archive
            gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -

       Addition Conditions

       If  the condition begins with '+' (or '+?') instead of '=' (or '=?') it
       is an addition condition. If the condition is true the menu entry  will
       be  included in the menu. If the condition is false the menu entry will
       not be included in the menu.

       You can combine default and addition conditions by  starting  condition
       with  '+='  or '=+' (or '+=?' or '=+?' if you want debug trace). If you
       want to use two different conditions, one for adding  and  another  for
       defaulting,  you can precede a menu entry with two condition lines, one
       starting with '+' and another starting with '='.

       Comments are started with '#'. The additional comment lines must  start
       with '#', space or tab.

  Options Menu
       The  Midnight Commander has some options that may be toggled on and off
       in several dialogs which are accessible from  this  menu.  Options  are
       enabled if they have an asterisk or "x" in front of them.

       The  Configuration  command  pops up a dialog from which you can change
       most of settings of the Midnight Commander.

       The Layout command pops up a dialog from which you specify a  bunch  of
       options how mc looks like on the screen.

       The  Confirmation command pops up a dialog from which you specify which
       actions you want to confirm.

       The Display bits command pops up a dialog from  which  you  may  select
       which characters is your terminal able to display.

       The  Learn  keys command pops up a dialog from which you test some keys
       which are not working on some terminals and you may fix them.

       The Virtual FS command pops up a dialog from which you specify some VFS
       related options.

       The  Save  setup  command saves the current settings of the Left, Right
       and Options menus. A small number of other settings is saved, too.

    Configuration
       The options in  this  dialog  are  divided  into  three  groups:  Panel
       Options, Pause after run and Other Options.

       Panel Options

       Show  Backup Files.  If enabled, the Midnight Commander will show files
       ending with a tilde.  Otherwise, they won't be  shown  (like  GNU's  ls
       option -B).

       Show  Hidden  Files.   If enabled, the Midnight Commander will show all
       files that start with a dot (like ls -a).

       Mark moves down.  If enabled, the selection bar will move down when you
       mark a file (with either C-t or the Insert key).

       Drop down menus.  When this option is enabled, the pull down menus will
       be activated as soon as you press the F9 key.  Otherwise, you will only
       get  the menu title, and you will have to activate the menu either with
       the arrow keys or with the hotkeys.  It is recommended if you are using
       hotkeys.

       Mix  all  files.   If this option is enabled, all files and directories
       are shown mixed together.  If the option is off, directories (and links
       to  directories)  are  shown at the beginning of the listing, and other
       files below.

       Fast directory reload.  If this option is enabled, the Midnight Comman-
       der  will  use  a  trick  to  determine  if the directory contents have
       changed.  The trick is to reload the directory only if  the  i-node  of
       the  directory  has  changed;  this means that reloads only happen when
       files are created or deleted.  If what changes is the i-node for a file
       in  the  directory  (file size changes, mode or owner changes, etc) the
       display is not updated.  In these cases, if you have the option on, you
       have to rescan the directory manually (with C-r).

       Pause after run

       After  executing  your  commands,  the Midnight Commander can pause, so
       that you can examine the output of the command.  There are three possi-
       ble settings for this variable:

       Never.   Means  that you do not want to see the output of your command.
       If you are using the Linux or FreeBSD console or an xterm, you will  be
       able to see the output of the command by typing C-o.

       On  dumb  terminals.   You will get the pause message on terminals that
       are not capable of showing the output of the last command executed (any
       terminal that is not an xterm or the Linux console).

       Always.  The program will pause after executing all of your commands.

       Other Options

       Verbose  operation.   This  toggles  whether  the file Copy, Rename and
       Delete operations are verbose (i.e., display  a  dialog  box  for  each
       operation).  If  you  have a slow terminal, you may wish to disable the
       verbose operation. It is automatically turned off if the speed of  your
       terminal is less than 9600 bps.

       Compute totals.  If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander com-
       putes total byte sizes and total number of files  prior  to  any  Copy,
       Rename  and  Delete operations. This will provide you with a more accu-
       rate progress bar at the expense of some  speed.  This  option  has  no
       effect, if Verbose operation is disabled.

       Shell  Patterns.   By  default the Select, Unselect and Filter commands
       will use shell-like regular expressions. The following conversions  are
       performed  to  achieve  this: the '*' is replaced by '.*' (zero or more
       characters); the '?'  is replaced by '.' (exactly  one  character)  and
       '.'  by  the  literal  dot. If the option is disabled, then the regular
       expressions are the ones described in ed(1).

       Auto Save Setup.  If this option is enabled, when you exit the Midnight
       Commander  the configurable options of the Midnight Commander are saved
       in the ~/.mc/ini file.

       Auto menus.  If this option is enabled, the user menu will  be  invoked
       at startup.  Useful for building menus for non-unixers.

       Use internal editor.  If this option is enabled, the built-in file edi-
       tor is used to edit files. If the option is disabled, the editor speci-
       fied in the EDITOR environment variable is used.  If no editor is spec-
       ified, vi is used.  See the section on the internal file editor.

       Use internal viewer.  If this option  is  enabled,  the  built-in  file
       viewer  is  used  to  view  files. If the option is disabled, the pager
       specified in the PAGER environment variable is used.  If  no  pager  is
       specified,  the  view command is used.  See the section on the internal
       file viewer.

       Complete: show all.  By default the Midnight Commander pops up all pos-
       sible completions if the completion is ambiguous only when you press M-
       Tab for the second time.  For the first time, it just completes as much
       as  possible and beeps in the case of ambiguity.  Enable this option if
       you want to see all possible completions even after pressing M-Tab  the
       first time.

       Rotating dash.  If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander shows
       a rotating dash in the upper right corner as a work in progress indica-
       tor.

       Lynx-like  motion.   If  this option is enabled, you may use the arrows
       keys to automatically chdir if the current selection is a  subdirectory
       and the shell command line is empty. By default, this setting is off.

       Cd  follows  links.  This option, if set, causes the Midnight Commander
       to follow the logical chain of directories when changing current direc-
       tory either in the panels, or using the cd command. This is the default
       behavior of bash. When unset, the Midnight Commander follows  the  real
       directory  structure, so cd .. if you've entered that directory through
       a link will move you to the current directory's real parent and not  to
       the directory where the link was present.

       Safe delete.  If this option is enabled, deleting files unintentionally
       becomes more difficult.  The  default  selection  in  the  confirmation
       dialogs  for  deletion changes from "Yes" to "No".  This option is dis-
       abled by default.

    Layout
       The layout dialog gives you a possibility to change the general  layout
       of screen. You can specify whether the menubar, the command prompt, the
       hintbar and the function keybar are visible. On the  Linux  or  FreeBSD
       console you can specify how many lines are shown in the output window.

       The  rest  of the screen area is used for the two directory panels. You
       can specify whether the area is split to the panels in vertical or hor-
       izontal direction. The split can be equal or you can specify an unequal
       split.

       You can specify whether permissions and  file  types  should  be  high-
       lighted  with  distinctive  Colors.   If the permission highlighting is
       enabled, the parts of the perm and mode display fields which  apply  to
       the  user  running  Midnight  Commander  are highlighted with the color
       defined by the selected keyword.  If  the  file  type  highlighting  is
       enabled,  files  are  colored according to their file type (e.g. direc-
       tory, core file, executable, and so on).

       If the Show Mini-Status option is enabled, one line of status  informa-
       tion  about  the  currently selected item is shown at the bottom of the
       panels.

       When run in a terminal emulator for X11, Midnight  Commander  sets  the
       terminal  window  title to the current working directory and updates it
       when necessary.  If your terminal emulator is broken and you  see  some
       incorrect  output  on  startup and directory change, turn off the Xterm
       Window Title option.

    Confirmation
       In this menu you configure the confirmation options for file  deletion,
       overwriting, execution by pressing enter and quitting the program.

    Display bits
       This  is  used  to  configure  the  range  of visible characters on the
       screen.  This setting may be 7-bits if  your  terminal/curses  supports
       only  seven  output bits, ISO-8859-1 displays all the characters in the
       ISO-8859-1 map and full 8 bits is for those terminals that can  display
       full 8 bit characters.

    Learn keys
       This  dialog  allows  you  to test and redefine functional keys, cursor
       arrows and some other keys to make them work properly on your terminal.
       They  often don't, since many terminal databases are incomplete or bro-
       ken.

       You can move around with the Tab key and with the vi moving  keys  ('h'
       left, 'j' down, 'k' up and 'l' right).  Once you press any cursor move-
       ment key and it is recognized, you can use that key as well.

       You can test keys just by pressing each of them.  When you press a  key
       and  it  is  recognized  properly, OK should appear next to the name of
       that key.  Once a key is marked OK it starts working as  usually,  e.g.
       F1  pressed  the  first time will just check that the F1 key works, but
       after that it will show help.  The same applies to the arrow keys.  The
       Tab key should be working always.

       If  some  keys  do not work properly then you won't see OK appear after
       pressing one of these.  Then you may want to redefine  it.   Do  it  by
       pressing  the  button with the name of that key (either by the mouse or
       by Enter or Space after selecting the button with Tab or arrows).  Then
       a message box will appear asking you to press that key.  Do it and wait
       until the message box disappears.  If you want  to  abort,  just  press
       Escape once and wait.

       When  you finish with all the keys, you can Save them.  The definitions
       for the keys you have  redefined  will  be  written  into  the  [termi-
       nal:TERM]  section  of  your  ~/.mc/ini file (where TERM is the name of
       your current terminal).  The definitions of the keys that were  already
       working properly are not saved.

    Virtual FS
       This  option  gives  you  control over the settings of the Virtual File
       System.

       The Midnight Commander keeps in memory the information related to  some
       of  the virtual file systems to speed up the access to the files in the
       file system (for example, directory listings fetched from FTP servers).

       Also, in order to access the contents of compressed files (for example,
       compressed  tar files) the Midnight Commander needs to create temporary
       uncompressed files on your disk.

       Since both the information in memory and the temporary  files  on  disk
       take  up  resources,  you may want to tune the parameters of the cached
       information to decrease your resource usage or to maximize the speed of
       access to frequently used file systems.

       Because  of the format of the tar archives, the Tar filesystem needs to
       read the whole file just to load the  file  entries.   Since  most  tar
       files  are  usually  kept  compressed  (plain  tar files are species in
       extinction), the tar file system has to uncompress the file on the disk
       in a temporary location and then access the uncompressed file as a reg-
       ular tar file.

       Now, since we all love to browse files and tar files all over the disk,
       it's  common  that you will leave a tar file and the re-enter it later.
       Since decompression is slow, the  Midnight  Commander  will  cache  the
       information  in  memory  for a limited time.  When the timeout expires,
       all the resources associated with the file system  are  released.   The
       default timeout is set to one minute.

       The  FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to browse directories on remote
       FTP servers.  It has several options.

       ftp anonymous password is the password used when you login  as  "anony-
       mous".   Some sites require a valid e-mail address.  On the other hand,
       you probably don't want to give your real e-mail address  to  untrusted
       sites, especially if you are not using spam filtering.

       ftpfs  keeps  the  directory  listing it fetches from a FTP server in a
       cache.  The cache expire time is configurable with the ftpfs  directory
       cache  timeout option.  A low value for this option may slow down every
       operation on the ftpfs because every operation would require sending  a
       request to the FTP server.

       You  can define an FTP proxy host for doing FTP.  Note that most modern
       firewalls are fully transparent at least for passive FTP  (see  below),
       so FTP proxies are considered obsolete.

       If Always use ftp proxy is not set, you can use the exclamation sign to
       enable proxy for certain hosts.  See FTP File System for examples.

       If this option is set, the program will  do  two  things:  consult  the
       /usr/lib/mc/mc.no_proxy  file  for lines containing host names that are
       local (if the host name starts with a  dot,  it  is  assumed  to  be  a
       domain)  and  to  assume that any hostnames without dots in their names
       are directly accessible.  All other hosts will be accessed through  the
       specified FTP proxy.

       You  can  enable using ~/.netrc file, which keeps login names and pass-
       words for ftp servers.  See netrc (5) for the description of the .netrc
       format.

       Use  passive  mode  enables using FTP passive mode, when the connection
       for data transfer is initiated by the client, not by the server.   This
       option is recommended and enabled by default.  If this option is turned
       off, the data connection is initiated by the server.  This may not work
       with some firewalls.

    Save Setup
       At  startup  the  Midnight  Commander  will  try to load initialization
       information from the ~/.mc/ini file. If this  file  doesn't  exist,  it
       will  load  the  information  from  the system-wide configuration file,
       located in /usr/share/mc/mc.ini. If the system-wide configuration  file
       doesn't exist, MC uses the default settings.

       The Save Setup command creates the ~/.mc/ini file by saving the current
       settings of the Left, Right and Options menus.

       If you activate the auto save setup option, MC  will  always  save  the
       current settings when exiting.

       There  also  exist  settings  which can't be changed from the menus. To
       change these settings you  have  to  edit  the  setup  file  with  your
       favorite  editor. See the section on Special Settings for more informa-
       tion.


Executing operating system commands
       You may execute commands by typing them directly in the  Midnight  Com-
       mander's  input  line,  or by selecting the program you want to execute
       with the selection bar in one of the panels and hitting Enter.

       If you press Enter over a file that is  not  executable,  the  Midnight
       Commander  checks the extension of the selected file against the exten-
       sions in the Extensions File.  If a match is found then the code  asso-
       ciated  with  that extension is executed. A very simple macro expansion
       takes place before executing the command.

  The cd internal command
       The cd command is interpreted by the  Midnight  Commander,  it  is  not
       passed  to the command shell for execution.  Thus it may not handle all
       of the nice macro expansion and  substitution  that  your  shell  does,
       although it does some of them:

       Tilde  substitution.  The (~) will be substituted with your home direc-
       tory, if you append a username after the tilde, then it will be substi-
       tuted with the login directory of the specified user.

       For  example,  ~guest  is  the home directory for the user guest, while
       ~/guest is the directory guest in your home directory.

       Previous directory.  You can jump to the directory you were  previously
       by using the special directory name '-' like this: cd -

       CDPATH  directories.   If  the directory specified to the cd command is
       not in the current directory, then  The  Midnight  Commander  uses  the
       value in the environment variable CDPATH to search for the directory in
       any of the named directories.

       For example you could  set  your  CDPATH  variable  to  ~/src:/usr/src,
       allowing  you to change your directory to any of the directories inside
       the ~/src and /usr/src directories, from any place in the  file  system
       by  using  its  relative  name  (for example cd linux could take you to
       /usr/src/linux).

  Macro Substitution
       When accessing a user menu, or executing an  extension  dependent  com-
       mand,  or running a command from the command line input, a simple macro
       substitution takes place.

       The macros are:

       %i     The indent of blank space, equal  the  cursor  column  position.
              For edit menu only.

       %y     The syntax type of current file. For edit menu only.

       %k     The block file name.

       %e     The error file name.

       %m     The current menu name.

       %f and %p
              The current file name.

       %x     The extension of current file name.

       %b     The current file name without extension.

       %d     The current directory name.

       %F     The current file in the unselected panel.

       %D     The directory name of the unselected panel.

       %t     The currently tagged files.

       %T     The tagged files in the unselected panel.

       %u and %U
              Similar  to  the %t and %T macros, but in addition the files are
              untagged.  You can use this macro only once per menu file  entry
              or  extension  file  entry,  because  next time there will be no
              tagged files.

       %s and %S
              The selected files: The tagged files if there are any. Otherwise
              the current file.

       %cd    This  is  a  special  macro  that  is used to change the current
              directory to the directory specified in front of  it.   This  is
              used primarily as an interface to the Virtual File System.

       %view  This  macro  is  used to invoke the internal viewer.  This macro
              can be used alone, or with arguments.  If you pass any arguments
              to this macro, they should be enclosed in brackets.

              The  arguments  are:  ascii to force the viewer into ascii mode;
              hex to force the viewer into hex mode; nroff to tell the  viewer
              that  it  should  interpret  the bold and underline sequences of
              nroff; unformatted to tell the viewer  to  not  interpret  nroff
              commands for making the text bold or underlined.

       %%     The % character

       %{some text}
              Prompt  for the substitution. An input box is shown and the text
              inside the braces is used as a prompt. The macro is  substituted
              by  the text typed by the user. The user can press ESC or F10 to
              cancel. This macro doesn't work on the command line yet.

       %var{ENV:default}
              If environment variable ENV is unset,  the  default  is  substi-
              tuted.  Otherwise, the value of ENV is substituted.

  The subshell support
       The  subshell  support  is  a  compile time option, that works with the
       shells: bash, tcsh and zsh.

       When the subshell code is activated the Midnight Commander will spawn a
       concurrent  copy  of  your shell (the one defined in the SHELL variable
       and if it is not defined, then the one in the /etc/passwd file) and run
       it  in a pseudo terminal, instead of invoking a new shell each time you
       execute a command, the command will be passed to the subshell as if you
       had  typed  it.   This  also allows you to change the environment vari-
       ables, use shell functions and define aliases that are valid until  you
       quit the Midnight Commander.

       If you are using bash you can specify startup commands for the subshell
       in your ~/.mc/bashrc file and special keyboard maps in the  ~/.mc/inpu-
       trc  file.  tcsh users may specify startup commands in the ~/.mc/tcshrc
       file.

       When the subshell code is used, you can  suspend  applications  at  any
       time  with the sequence C-o and jump back to the Midnight Commander, if
       you interrupt an application, you will not be able to run other  exter-
       nal commands until you quit the application you interrupted.

       An  extra  added  feature of using the subshell is that the prompt dis-
       played by the Midnight Commander is the same prompt that you  are  cur-
       rently using in your shell.

       The  OPTIONS  section  has  more information on how you can control the
       subshell code.

Chmod
       The Chmod window is used to change the attribute bits  in  a  group  of
       files  and  directories.  It can be invoked with the C-x c key combina-
       tion.

       The Chmod window has two parts - Permissions and File.

       In the File section are displayed the name of the file or directory and
       its permissions in octal form, as well as its owner and group.

       In the Permissions section there is a set of check buttons which corre-
       spond to the file attribute bits.  As you change  the  attribute  bits,
       you can see the octal value change in the File section.

       To  move  between the widgets (buttons and check buttons) use the arrow
       keys or the Tab key.  To change the state of the check  buttons  or  to
       select a button use Space.  You can also use the hotkeys on the buttons
       to quickly activate them.  Hotkeys are shown as highlighted letters  on
       the buttons.

       To set the attribute bits, use the Enter key.

       When  working  with  a group of files or directories, you just click on
       the bits you want to set or clear.  Once you have selected the bits you
       want  to  change,  you  select one of the action buttons (Set marked or
       Clear marked).

       Finally, to set the attributes exactly to those specified, you can  use
       the [Set all] button, which will act on all the tagged files.

       [Marked all] set only marked attributes to all selected files

       [Set marked] set marked bits in attributes of all selected files

       [Clean marked] clear marked bits in attributes of all selected files

       [Set] set the attributes of one file

       [Cancel] cancel the Chmod command

Chown
       The  Chown command is used to change the owner/group of a file. The hot
       key for this command is C-x o.

Advanced Chown
       The Advanced Chown command is the Chmod and Chown command combined into
       one  window. You can change the permissions and owner/group of files at
       once.

File Operations
       When you copy, move or delete files the Midnight  Commander  shows  the
       file  operations  dialog.  It shows the files currently being processed
       and uses up to three progress bars.  The file bar  indicates  the  per-
       centage  of the current file that has been processed so far.  The count
       bar shows how many of the tagged files have been  handled.   The  bytes
       bar indicates the percentage of the total size of the tagged files that
       has been handled.  If the verbose option is off,  the  file  and  bytes
       bars are not shown.

       There  are  two  buttons at the bottom of the dialog. Pressing the Skip
       button will skip the rest of the current file. Pressing the Abort  but-
       ton will abort the whole operation, the rest of the files are skipped.

       There  are  three  other dialogs which you can run into during the file
       operations.

       The error dialog informs about error conditions and has three  choices.
       Normally  you  select  either  the  Skip button to skip the file or the
       Abort button to abort the operation altogether.  You  can  also  select
       the Retry button if you fixed the problem from another terminal.

       The  replace dialog is shown when you attempt to copy or move a file on
       the top of an existing file.  The dialog shows the dates and  sizes  of
       the  both  files.   Press  the Yes button to overwrite the file, the No
       button to skip the file, the All button to overwrite all the files, the
       None  button  to  never overwrite and the Update button to overwrite if
       the source file is newer than the target file.  You can abort the whole
       operation by pressing the Abort button.

       The recursive delete dialog is shown when you try to delete a directory
       which is not empty.  Press the  Yes  button  to  delete  the  directory
       recursively,  the  No  button  to skip the directory, the All button to
       delete all the directories and the None button to  skip  all  the  non-
       empty  directories.   You can abort the whole operation by pressing the
       Abort button.  If you selected the Yes or All button you will be  asked
       for a confirmation.  Type "yes" only if you are really sure you want to
       do the recursive delete.

       If you have tagged files and perform an  operation  on  them  only  the
       files on which the operation succeeded are untagged. Failed and skipped
       files are left tagged.

Mask Copy/Rename
       The copy/move operations let you translate the names  of  files  in  an
       easy  way.   To  do it, you have to specify the correct source mask and
       usually in the trailing part of the destination specify some wildcards.
       All  the files matching the source mask are copied/renamed according to
       the target mask.  If there are tagged  files,  only  the  tagged  files
       matching the source mask are renamed.

       There are other options which you can set:

       Follow links

       determines whether make the symlinks and hardlinks in the source direc-
       tory (recursively in subdirectories) new links in the target  directory
       or whether would you like to copy their content.

       Dive into subdirs

       determines  the  behavior  when  the  source  directory  is about to be
       copied, but the target directory already exists.  The default action is
       to copy the contents of the source directory into the target directory.
       Enabling this option causes copying the source  directory  itself  into
       the target directory.

       For  example,  you  want  to copy directory /foo containing file bar to
       /bla/foo, which is an already existing directory.  Normally (when  Dive
       into  subdirs  is  not  set), mc would copy file /foo/bar into the file
       /bla/foo/bar.  By enabling this option the /bla/foo/foo directory  will
       be created, and /foo/bar will be copied into /bla/foo/foo/bar.

       Preserve attributes

       determines  whether to preserve the permissions, timestamps and (if you
       are root) the ownership of the original files.  If this option  is  not
       set, the current value of the umask will be respected.

       Use shell patterns on

       When the shell patterns option is on you can use the '*' and '?'  wild-
       cards in the source mask.  They work like they do in the shell.  In the
       target  mask  only  the  '*' and '\<digit>' wildcards are allowed.  The
       first '*' wildcard in the target mask corresponds to the first wildcard
       group  in  the  source  mask,  the second '*' corresponds to the second
       group and so on.  The '\1' wildcard corresponds to the  first  wildcard
       group  in  the source mask, the '\2' wildcard corresponds to the second
       group and so on all the way up to '\9'.  The '\0' wildcard is the whole
       filename of the source file.

       Two examples:

       If  the  source mask is "*.tar.gz", the destination is "/bla/*.tgz" and
       the file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy will  be  "foo.tgz"  in
       "/bla".

       Suppose  you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" would
       become "c.file" and so on.  The source mask for this is "*.*"  and  the
       destination is "\2.\1".

       Use shell patterns off

       When  the  shell  patterns  option  is  off the MC doesn't do automatic
       grouping anymore. You must use '\(...\)' expressions in the source mask
       to  specify  meaning for the wildcards in the target mask. This is more
       flexible but also requires more typing. Otherwise target masks are sim-
       ilar to the situation when the shell patterns option is on.

       Two examples:

       If   the   source  mask  is  "^\(.*\)\.tar\.gz$",  the  destination  is
       "/bla/*.tgz" and the file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the  copy  will
       be "/bla/foo.tgz".

       Let's  suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c"
       will  become  "c.file"  and  so  on.  The  source  mask  for  this   is
       "^\(.*\)\.\(.*\)$" and the destination is "\2.\1".

       Case Conversions

       You can also change the case of the filenames.  If you use '\u' or '\l'
       in the target mask, the next character will be converted  to  uppercase
       or lowercase correspondingly.

       If you use '\U' or '\L' in the target mask, the next characters will be
       converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly up to the next '\E'
       or next '\U', '\L' or the end of the file name.

       The '\u' and '\l' are stronger than '\U' and '\L'.

       For  example,  if  the  source  mask  is  '*'  (shell  patterns  on) or
       '^\(.*\)$' (shell patterns off) and the target mask is '\L\u*' the file
       names  will be converted to have initial upper case and otherwise lower
       case.

       You can also use '\' as a quote character. For example, '\\' is a back-
       slash and '\*' is an asterisk.

Internal File Viewer
       The internal file viewer provides two display modes: ASCII and hex.  To
       toggle between modes, use the F4 key.  If you have the GNU gzip program
       installed,  it  will  be  used to automatically decompress the files on
       demand.

       The viewer will try to use the best method provided by your  system  or
       the  file  type  to  display the information.  The internal file viewer
       will interpret some string sequences to  set  the  bold  and  underline
       attributes, thus making a pretty display of your files.

       When  in  hex mode, the search function accepts text in quotes and con-
       stant numbers.  Text in quotes is matched exactly  after  removing  the
       quotes.   Each  number  matches one byte.  You can mix quoted text with
       constants like this:

       "String" -1 0xBB 012 "more text"

       Note that 012 is an octal number.  -1 is converted to 0xFF.

       Some internal details about the viewer: On  systems  that  provide  the
       mmap(2)  system  call, the program maps the file instead of loading it;
       if the system does not provide the mmap(2)  system  call  or  the  file
       matches  an action that requires a filter, then the viewer will use its
       growing buffers, thus loading only those parts of  the  file  that  you
       actually access (this includes compressed files).

       Here is a listing of the actions associated with each key that the Mid-
       night Commander handles in the internal file viewer.

       F1 Invoke the built-in hypertext help viewer.

       F2 Toggle the wrap mode.

       F4 Toggle the hex mode.

       F5 Goto line.  This will prompt you for a line number and will  display
       that line.

       F6, /.  Regular expression search.

       ?, Reverse regular expression search.

       F7 Normal search / hex mode search.

       C-s,  F17,  n.   Start  normal  search  if there was no previous search
       expression else find next match.

       C-r.  Start reverse search if there was no previous  search  expression
       else find next match.

       F8  Toggle Raw/Parsed mode: This will show the file as found on disk or
       if a processing filter has been specified in the mc.ext file, then  the
       output  from  the filter. Current mode is always the other than written
       on the button label, since on the button is the mode which you enter by
       that key.

       F9  Toggle  the format/unformat mode: when format mode is on the viewer
       will interpret some string sequences to show bold  and  underline  with
       different colors. Also, on button label is the other mode than current.

       F10, Esc.  Exit the internal file viewer.

       next-page, space, C-v.  Scroll one page forward.

       prev-page, M-v, C-b, backspace.  Scroll one page backward.

       down-key Scroll one line forward.

       up-key Scroll one line backward.

       C-l Refresh the screen.

       C-o Switch to the subshell and show the command screen.

       !  Like C-o, but run a new shell if the subshell is not running.

       [n] m Set the mark n.

       [n] r Jump to the mark n.

       C-f Jump to the next file.

       C-b Jump to the previous file.

       M-r Toggle the ruler.

       It's  possible  to instruct the file viewer how to display a file, look
       at the Extension File Edit section

Internal File Editor
       The internal file editor is a full-featured full screen editor.  It can
       edit  files  up  to 64 megabytes.  It is possible to edit binary files.
       The internal file editor is invoked using F4 if  the  use_internal_edit
       option is set in the initialization file.

       The  features it presently supports are: block copy, move, delete, cut,
       paste; key for key undo; pull-down menus; file  insertion;  macro  com-
       mands;  regular expression search and replace (and our own scanf-printf
       search and replace); shift-arrow text highlighting (if supported by the
       terminal);  insert-overwrite toggle; word wrap; autoindent; tunable tab
       size; syntax highlighting for various file types; and an option to pipe
       text blocks through shell commands like indent and ispell.

       The  editor  is  very easy to use and requires no tutoring. To see what
       keys do what, just consult the appropriate pull-down menu.  Other  keys
       are:  Shift movement keys do text highlighting.  Ctrl-Ins copies to the
       file cooledit.clip and Shift-Ins pastes from cooledit.clip.   Shift-Del
       cuts  to  cooledit.clip,  and  Ctrl-Del deletes highlighted text. Mouse
       highlighting also works, and you can override the  mouse  as  usual  by
       holding  down the shift key while dragging the mouse to let normal ter-
       minal mouse highlighting work.

       To define a macro, press Ctrl-R and then type out the key  strokes  you
       want  to  be  executed.  Press Ctrl-R again when finished. You can then
       assign the macro to any key you like by pressing that key. The macro is
       executed  when you press Ctrl-A and then the assigned key. The macro is
       also executed if you press Meta, Ctrl, or Esc  and  the  assigned  key,
       provided that the key is not used for any other function. Once defined,
       the macro commands go into the file .mc/cedit/cooledit.macros  in  your
       home directory. You can delete a macro by deleting the appropriate line
       in this file.

       F19 will format the currently highlighted block (plain text or C or C++
       code    or    another).    This    is    controlled    by    the   file
       /usr/share/mc/edit.indent.rc       which       is       copied       to
       .mc/cedit/edit.indent.rc  in your home directory the first time you use
       it.

       You can use scanf search and replace to search and replace a  C  format
       string.  First  take  a look at the sscanf and sprintf man pages to see
       what a format string is and how it works.  Consider following  example.
       Suppose  you  want to replace all occurrences of an open bracket, three
       comma separated numbers, and a close bracket, with the word apples, the
       third  number,  the word oranges and then the second number.  Then fill
       in the Replace dialog box as follows:

        Enter search string:
         (%d,%d,%d)
        Enter replacement string:
         apples %d oranges %d
        Enter replacement argument order:
         3,2

       The last line specifies that the third and then the second  number  are
       to be used in place of the first and second.

       It  is advisable to use this feature with Prompt on replace on, because
       a match is thought to be found whenever the number of  arguments  found
       matches  the number given, which is not always a real match. Scanf also
       treats whitespace as being elastic.  Note that the scanf format  %[  is
       very useful for scanning strings, and whitespace.

       The  editor also displays non-us characters (160+). When editing binary
       files, you should set display bits to 7 bits in  the  options  menu  to
       keep the spacing clean.

Completion
       Let the Midnight Commander type for you.

       Attempt  to perform completion on the text before current position.  MC
       attempts completion treating the text as variable (if the  text  begins
       with  $),  username  (if the text begins with ~), hostname (if the text
       begins with @) or command (if you are on the command line in the  posi-
       tion  where you might type a command, possible completions then include
       shell reserved words and shell built-in commands as well) in turn.   If
       none of these matches, filename completion is attempted.

       Filename, username, variable and hostname completion works on all input
       lines, command completion is command line specific.  If the  completion
       is ambiguous (there are more different possibilities), MC beeps and the
       following action depends on the  setting  of  the  Complete:  show  all
       option  in  the  Configuration dialog.  If it is enabled, a list of all
       possibilities pops up next to the current position and you  can  select
       with the arrow keys and Enter the correct entry.  You can also type the
       first letters in which the possibilities differ to move to a subset  of
       all possibilities and complete as much as possible.  If you press M-Tab
       again, only the subset will be shown  in  the  listbox,  otherwise  the
       first  item  which  matches  all  the previous characters will be high-
       lighted.  As soon as there is no ambiguity, dialog disappears, but  you
       can  hide  it by canceling keys Esc, F10 and left and right arrow keys.
       If Complete: show all is disabled, the dialog pops up only if you press
       M-Tab for the second time, for the first time MC just beeps.

Virtual File System
       The Midnight Commander is provided with a code layer to access the file
       system; this code layer is known as the  virtual  file  system  switch.
       The virtual file system switch allows the Midnight Commander to manipu-
       late files not located on the Unix file system.

       Currently the Midnight Commander is packaged  with  some  Virtual  File
       Systems  (VFS):  the  local file system, used for accessing the regular
       Unix file system; the ftpfs, used to manipulate files on remote systems
       with the FTP protocol; the tarfs, used to manipulate tar and compressed
       tar files; the undelfs, used to recover deleted files on ext2 file sys-
       tems  (the default file system for Linux systems), fish (for manipulat-
       ing files over shell connections such as rsh and ssh) and  finally  the
       mcfs (Midnight Commander file system), a network based file system.  If
       the code was compiled with smbfs support, you can manipulate  files  on
       remote systems with the SMB (CIFS) protocol.

       A  generic extfs (EXTernal virtual File System) is provided in order to
       easily expand VFS capabilities using scripts and external software.

       The VFS switch code will interpret all of the path names used and  will
       forward  them to the correct file system, the formats used for each one
       of the file systems is described later in their own section.

  FTP File System
       The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to manipulate  files  on  remote
       machines.   To  actually  use  it, you can use the FTP link item in the
       menu or directly change your current directory using the cd command  to
       a path name that looks like this:

       /#ftp:[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote-dir]

       The  user,  port  and remote-dir elements are optional.  If you specify
       the user element, the Midnight  Commander  will  login  to  the  remote
       machine  as  that  user,  otherwise  it will use anonymous login or the
       login name from the ~/.netrc file.  The optional pass  element  is  the
       password used for the connection.  Using the password in the VFS direc-
       tory name is not recommended, because it can appear on  the  screen  in
       clear text and can be saved to the directory history.

       To  enable  using  FTP  proxy,  prepend !  (an exclamation sign) to the
       hostname.

       Examples:

           /#ftp:ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local
           /#ftp:tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages
           /#ftp:!behind.firewall.edu/pub
           /#ftp:guest@remote-host.com:40/pub
           /#ftp:miguel:xxx@server/pub

       Please check the Virtual File System dialog box for ftpfs options.

  Tar File System
       The tar file system provides you with  read-only  access  to  your  tar
       files  and  compressed tar files by using the chdir command.  To change
       your directory to a tar file, you change your current directory to  the
       tar file by using the following syntax:

       /filename.tar#utar/[dir-inside-tar]

       The  mc.ext  file already provides a shortcut for tar files, this means
       that usually you just point to a tar file and  press  return  to  enter
       into  the  tar file, see the Extension File Edit section for details on
       how this is done.

       Examples:

           mc-3.0.tar.gz#utar/mc-3.0/vfs
           /ftp/GCC/gcc-2.7.0.tar#utar

       The latter specifies the full path of the tar archive.

  FIle transfer over SHell filesystem
       The fish file system is a network based file system that allows you  to
       manipulate  the files in a remote machine as if they were local. To use
       this, the other side has to either run fish  server,  or  has  to  have
       bash-compatible shell.

       To  connect  to a remote machine, you just need to chdir into a special
       directory which name is in the following format:

       /#sh:[user@]machine[:options]/[remote-dir]

       The user, options and remote-dir elements are optional.  If you specify
       the  user  element,  the  Midnight  Commander  will try to login on the
       remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use your login name.

       The options are 'C' - use compression and 'rsh' use rsh instead of ssh.
       If  the  remote-dir  element  is present, your current directory on the
       remote machine will be set to this one.

       Examples:

           /#sh:onlyrsh.mx:r/linux/local
           /#sh:joe@want.compression.edu:C/private
           /#sh:joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu/private

  Network File System
       The Midnight Commander file system is a network base file  system  that
       allows  you to manipulate the files in a remote machine as if they were
       local.  To use this, the remote machine must be running  the  mcserv(8)
       server program.

       To  connect  to a remote machine, you just need to chdir into a special
       directory which name is in the following format:

       /#mc:[user@]machine[:port][remote-dir]

       The user, port and remote-dir elements are optional.   If  you  specify
       the  user  element then the Midnight Commander will try to logon on the
       remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use your login name.

       The port element is used when the remote server is running on a special
       port  (see the mcserv(8) manual page for more information about ports);
       finally, if the remote-dir element is present, your  current  directory
       on the remote machine will be set to this one.

       Examples:

           /#mc:ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local
           /#mc:joe@foo.edu:11321/private

  Undelete File System
       On  Linux  systems,  if  you asked configure to use the ext2fs undelete
       facilities, you will have the undelete file system available.  Recovery
       of  deleted files is only available on ext2 file systems.  The undelete
       file system is just an interface to the ext2fs library to retrieve  all
       of the deleted files names on an ext2fs and provides and to extract the
       selected files into a regular partition.

       To use this file system, you have to chdir into the special  file  name
       formed  by the "/#undel" prefix and the file name where the actual file
       system resides.

       For example, to recover deleted files on the second  partition  of  the
       first SCSI disk on Linux, you would use the following path name:

           /#undel:sda2

       It  may  take  a while for the undelfs to load the required information
       before you start browsing files there.

  SMB File System
       The smbfs allows you to manipulate files on remote  machines  with  SMB
       (or  CIFS)  protocol.   These  include  Windows for Workgroups, Windows
       9x/ME/XP, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Samba.  To actually use it,  you
       may  try  to  use the panel command "SMB link..."  (accessible from the
       menubar) or you may directly change your current directory to it  using
       the cd command to a path name that looks like this:

       /#smb:[user@]machine[/service][/remote-dir]

       The  user,  service  and  remote-dir  elements are optional.  The user,
       domain and password can be specified in an input dialog.

       Examples:

           /#smb:machine/Share
           /#smb:other_machine
           /#smb:guest@machine/Public/Irlex

  EXTernal File System
       extfs allows to integrate numerous features and  file  types  into  GNU
       Midnight Commander in an easy way, by writing scripts.

       Extfs filesystems can be divided into two categories:

       1.  Stand-alone filesystems, which are not associated with any existing
       file.  They represent certain system-wide data  as  a  directory  tree.
       You  can  invoke  them  by typing 'cd #fsname' where fsname is an extfs
       short name (see below).  Examples of  such  filesystems  include  audio
       (list  audio  tracks  on the CD) or apt (list of all Debian packages in
       the system).

       For example, to list CD-Audio tracks on your CD-ROM drive, type

         cd #audio

       2. 'Archive' filesystems (like rpm, patchfs and more), which  represent
       contents of a file as a directory tree.  It can consist of 'real' files
       compressed in an archive (urar, rpm) or virtual files, like messages in
       a  mailbox  (mailfs)  or  parts  of  a patch (patchfs).  To access such
       filesystems '#fsname' should be appended to  the  archive  name.   Note
       that the archive itself can be on another vfs.

       For example, to list contents of a zip archive documents.zip type

         cd documents.zip#uzip

       In  many  aspects, you could treat extfs like any other directory.  For
       instance, you can add it to the hotlist or change to it from  directory
       history.   An important limitation is that you cannot invoke shell com-
       mands inside extfs, just like any other non-local VFS.

       Common extfs scripts included with Midnight Commander are:

       a      access 'A:' DOS/Windows diskette (cd #a).

       apt    front end to Debian's APT package management system (cd #apt).

       audio  audio CD ripping and playing (cd #audio or cd device#audio).

       bpp    package of Bad Penguin GNU/Linux distribution (cd file.bpp#bpp).

       deb    package of Debian GNU/Linux distribution (cd file.deb#deb).

       dpkg   Debian GNU/Linux installed packages (cd #deb).

       hp48   view and copy files to/from a HP48 calculator (cd #hp48).

       lslR   browsing of lslR listings  as  found  on  many  FTPs  (cd  file-
              name#lslR).

       mailfs mbox-style mailbox files support (cd mailbox#mailfs).

       patchfs
              extfs to handle unified and context diffs (cd filename#patchfs).

       rpm    RPM package (cd filename#rpm).

       rpms   RPM database management (cd #rpms).

       ulha, urar, uzip, uzoo, uar, uha
              archivers  (cd  archive#xxxx  where  xxxx is one of: ulha, urar,
              uzip, uzoo, uar, uha).

       You could bind file type/extension to specified extfs as  described  in
       the  Extension  File Edit section.  Here is an example entry for Debian
       packages:

         regex/.deb$
                 Open=%cd %p#deb

Colors
       The Midnight Commander will try to detect  if  your  terminal  supports
       color using the terminal database and your terminal name.  Sometimes it
       gets confused, so you may force color mode or disable color mode  using
       the -c and -b flag respectively.

       If  the  program  is  compiled with the Slang screen manager instead of
       ncurses, it will also check the variable COLORTERM, if it  is  set,  it
       has the same effect as the -c flag.

       You  may  specify  terminals that always force color mode by adding the
       color_terminals variable to the Colors section  of  the  initialization
       file.   This  will prevent the Midnight Commander from trying to detect
       if your terminal supports color.  Example:

       [Colors]
       color_terminals=linux,xterm
       color_terminals=terminal-name1,terminal-name2...

       The program can be compiled with both ncurses and slang,  ncurses  does
       not  provide  a way to force color mode: ncurses uses just the informa-
       tion in the terminal database.

       The Midnight Commander provides a way to  change  the  default  colors.
       Currently  the  colors  are  configured  using the environment variable
       MC_COLOR_TABLE or the Colors section in the initialization file.

       In the Colors section,  the  default  color  map  is  loaded  from  the
       base_color variable.  You can specify an alternate color map for a ter-
       minal by using the terminal name as the key in this section.  Example:

       [Colors]
       base_color=
       xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red

       The format for the color definition is:

         <keyword>=<foregroundcolor>,<backgroundcolor>:<keyword>= ...

       The colors are  optional,  and  the  keywords  are:  normal,  selected,
       marked,  markselect,  errors,  input, reverse, gauge.  Menu colors are:
       menu, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel.  Dialog colors are:  dnormal,  dfo-
       cus,  dhotnormal,  dhotfocus.  Help colors are: helpnormal, helpitalic,
       helpbold, helplink, helpslink.  Viewer color is:  viewunderline.   Spe-
       cial  highlighting  colors are: executable, directory, link, stalelink,
       device, special, core.  Editor colors are: editnormal, editbold,  edit-
       marked.

       input determines the color of input lines used in query dialogs.

       gauge  determines  the  color  of  the  filled part of the progress bar
       (gauge), which is used to show the user the  progress  of  file  opera-
       tions, such as copying.

       The dialog boxes use the following colors: dnormal is used for the nor-
       mal text, dfocus is the color used for the  currently  selected  compo-
       nent, dhotnormal is the color used to differentiate the hotkey color in
       normal components, whereas the dhotfocus color is used  for  the  high-
       lighted color in the currently selected component.

       Menus  use  the  same  scheme  but  uses the menu, menusel, menuhot and
       menuhotsel tags instead.

       Help uses the following colors: helpnormal is  used  for  normal  text,
       helpitalic is used for text which is emphasized in italic in the manual
       page, helpbold is used for text which is emphasized in bold in the man-
       ual page, helplink is used for not selected hyperlinks and helpslink is
       used for selected hyperlink.

       Special highlight colors determine how files are  displayed  when  file
       highlighting is enabled (see the section on Layout).  directory is used
       for directories or symbolic links to directories; executable  for  exe-
       cutable  files; link is used for symbolic links which are neither stale
       nor linked to a directory; stalelink is used for stale symbolic  links;
       device  -  character  and  block  devices;  special is used for special
       files, such as pipes and sockets; core is for core files.

       The possible colors are: black, gray, red,  brightred,  green,  bright-
       green,  brown,  yellow, blue, brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta, cyan,
       brightcyan, lightgray and white. And there is  a  special  keyword  for
       transparent background. It is 'default'. The 'default' can only be used
       for background color. Example:

       [Colors]
       base_color=normal=white,default:marked=magenta,default

Special Settings
       Most of the settings of the Midnight Commander can be changed from  the
       menus.  However, there are a small number of settings which can only be
       changed by editing the setup file.

       These variables may be set in your ~/.mc/ini file:

       clear_before_exec
              By default the Midnight Commander clears the screen before  exe-
              cuting  a command.  If you would prefer to see the output of the
              command at the bottom of the screen, edit  your  ~/.mc/ini  file
              and change the value of the field clear_before_exec to 0.

       confirm_view_dir
              If  you  press F3 on a directory, normally MC enters that direc-
              tory.  If this flag is set to 1, then MC will ask for  confirma-
              tion before changing the directory if you have files tagged.

       ftpfs_retry_seconds
              This  value is the number of seconds the Midnight Commander will
              wait before attempting to reconnect to an FTP  server  that  has
              denied  the  login.   If the value is zero, the login will no be
              retried.

       max_dirt_limit
              Specifies how many screen updates can be skipped at most in  the
              internal  file  viewer.  Normally this value is not significant,
              because the code automatically adjusts the number of updates  to
              skip  according to the rate of incoming keystrokes.  However, on
              very slow machines  or  terminals  with  a  fast  keyboard  auto
              repeat, a big value can make screen updates too jumpy.

              It  seems  that  setting  max_dirt_limit  to  10 causes the best
              behavior, and that is the default value.

       mouse_move_pages
              Controls whenever scrolling with the mouse is done by  pages  or
              line by line on the panels.

       mouse_move_pages_viewer
              Controls if scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or line by
              line on the internal file viewer.

       old_esc_mode
              By default the Midnight Commander treats the ESC key  as  a  key
              prefix    (old_esc_mode=0).     If    this    option    is   set
              (old_esc_mode=1), the ESC key will act as a prefix key  for  one
              second,  and  if no extra keys have arrived, then the ESC key is
              interpreted as a cancel key (ESC ESC).

       only_leading_plus_minus
              Allow special treatment for '+', '-', '*' in  the  command  line
              (select,  unselect,  reverse selection) only if the command line
              is empty.  You don't need to quote those characters in the  mid-
              dle of the command line.  On the other hand, you cannot use them
              to change selection when the command line is not empty.

       panel_scroll_pages
              If set (the default), panel will scroll by half the display when
              the cursor reaches the end or the beginning of the panel, other-
              wise it will just scroll a file at a time.

       show_output_starts_shell
              This variable only works if you are not using the subshell  sup-
              port.   When  you  use  the C-o keystroke to go back to the user
              screen, if this one is set, you will get a fresh shell.   Other-
              wise,  pressing any key will bring you back to the Midnight Com-
              mander.

       torben_fj_mode
              If this flag is set, then  the  home  and  end  keys  will  work
              slightly  different  on the panels, instead of moving the selec-
              tion to the first and last files in the panels, they will act as
              follows:

              The  home  key will: Go up to the middle line, if below it; else
              go to the top line unless it is already on the top line, in this
              case it will go to the first file in the panel.

              The  end key has a similar behavior: Go down to the middle line,
              if over it; else go to the bottom line unless you already are at
              the  bottom line, in such case it will move the selection to the
              last file name in the panel.

       use_file_to_guess_type
              If this variable is on (the default) it will spawn the file com-
              mand to match the file types listed on the mc.ext file.

       xterm_mode
              If this variable is on (default is off) when you browse the file
              system on a Tree panel, it will automatically reload  the  other
              panel with the contents of the selected directory.

Terminal databases
       The Midnight Commander provides a way to fix your system terminal data-
       base  without  requiring  root  privileges.   The  Midnight   Commander
       searches  in the system initialization file (the mc.lib file located in
       the Midnight Commander library directory) and in the ~/.mc/ini file for
       the  section  "terminal:your-terminal-name"  and  then  for the section
       "terminal:general", each line of the section contains a key symbol that
       you  want  to  define, followed by an equal sign and the definition for
       the key.  You can use the special \e form to represent the escape char-
       acter and the ^x to represent the control-x character.

       The possible key symbols are:

       f0 to f20     Function keys f0-f20
       bs            backspace
       home          home key
       end           end key
       up            up arrow key
       down          down arrow key
       left          left arrow key
       right         right arrow key
       pgdn          page down key
       pgup          page up key
       insert        the insert character
       delete        the delete character
       complete      to do completion

       For example, to define the key insert to be the Escape + [ + O + p, you
       set this in the ini file:

       insert=\e[Op

       The complete key symbol represents the escape sequences used to  invoke
       the  completion process, this is invoked with M-tab, but you can define
       other keys to do the same work (on those keyboard with tons of nice and
       unused keys everywhere).


FILES
       Full  paths  below  may  vary  between  installations.   They  are also
       affected by the MC_DATADIR environment  variable.   If  it's  set,  its
       value is used instead of /usr/share/mc in the paths below.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.hlp

              The help file for the program.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.ext

              The default system-wide extensions file.

       ~/.mc/bindings

              User's  own extension, view configuration and edit configuration
              file.  They override the contents of the system  wide  files  if
              present.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.ini

              The  default  system-wide setup for the Midnight Commander, used
              only if the user doesn't have his own ~/.mc/ini file.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.lib

              Global settings for the Midnight Commander.   Settings  in  this
              file affect all users, whether they have ~/.mc/ini or not.  Cur-
              rently, only terminal settings are loaded from mc.lib.

       ~/.mc/ini

              User's own setup. If this file is  present  then  the  setup  is
              loaded from here instead of the system-wide startup file.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.hint

              This file contains the hints displayed by the program.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.menu

              This file contains the default system-wide applications menu.

       ~/.mc/menu

              User's  own application menu. If this file is present it is used
              instead of the system-wide applications menu.

       ~/.mc/Tree

              The directory list for the directory tree  and  tree  view  fea-
              tures.

       ./.mc.menu

              Local  user-defined  menu.  If  this file is present, it is used
              instead of the home or system-wide applications menu.

MC Version 4.6.1-pre4              June 2005                             MC(1)
